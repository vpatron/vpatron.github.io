Vince has loved to tinker since he was a kid. His first electrical experiment was at the tender age of 5 when he stuck a nail into an electrical outlet. This was in the Philippines where power outlets put out 220 Volts AC. 

Having survived his first experiment, he was inspired to learn more of this curious phenomenon of electricity and soon moved on to playing with batteries and lightbulbs and little motors. He read every science book in his elementary school's library. It soon became obvious that he was destined to be an engineer. The rest is history.

He lives in San Diego with his beautiful and charming wife.
